# 🚗 Dynamic Speed Limit Notification 🚧

Enhance your FiveM server with this sleek, real-time speed limit notification script! This script dynamically displays a speed limit sign 🛑 as players enter predefined zones, updating the displayed speed in km/h or mph based on each zone's configuration.

### ✨ Features:
- **Zone-Based Alerts** 🌍: Automatically shows the speed limit as players enter custom zones.
- **Smooth Fade Animations** 🎬: Adds a professional touch with smooth fade-in and fade-out effects when entering or leaving zones.
- **Auto-Hide Display** ⏳: Speed notification hides after 5 seconds to keep the interface clean.
- **Customizable Speed Limits** 🚦: Easily set zone-specific speed limits in km/h or mph to match real-world driving.

### ⚙️ How It Works:
- The script detects when a player’s vehicle enters a speed-limited area, showing the speed limit notification at the screen's edge.
- If a player exits the zone or leaves their vehicle, the notification fades out for a distraction-free experience.
  
Perfect for roleplay servers or realistic driving mods! 🎮
